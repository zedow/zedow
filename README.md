## Hi there 👋

### About me 🙋🏻‍♂️
I'm a software developer with 5 years of experience, specializing in the energy and finance sectors for the past 3 years.
I enjoy coding, building systems, and continuously learning new things.

#### My skills 💻
I have 3 years of experience working on C# .NET projects and 5 years on Angular projects. 
I also have some DevOps and project management skills that I acquired during my studies.

#### Soft skills 🎯
I've worked in both large companies and small startups, and I can easily adapt to both environments.
I've learned how to provide effective project follow-up and deliver clear, consistent feedback to non-technical stakeholders.

#### What for the futur 🦀
I'm currently learning Rust, a new skill I'm excited about 🦀. 
I hope to work on Rust projects in the future, and plan to start by building my own Rust projects to gain more experience.
